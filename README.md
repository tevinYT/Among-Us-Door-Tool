**This was not made with the intent of being a cheat or anything like that, I did it because I was lazy.**

Welcome to Tevin's Door Tool V1!
Right not it ONLY supports 1920x1080 and I don't plan on changing it really.
I made it to see if I could, and it worked.

If there's interest I'll look into optimizing it but for now it's perfectly fast enough.

Here's a video on it:

UPDATE 11/31 11:20PM: I made a installer that will install all resources necessary to run the tool, alongside an exe for the script as well!
